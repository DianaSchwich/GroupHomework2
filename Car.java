    Create a Class Car that would have the following fields: carPrice and

    Create 2 sub classes: Sedan and Truck. The Truck class has a field
    as weight and has its own implementation of calculateSalePrice()
    method in which returned price is calculated as following: if
    weight>2000 then returned price car should include 10% discount,
    otherwise 20% discount.
    The Sedan class has field as length and also does it is own
    implementation of calculateSalePrice(): if length of sedan is >20 feet
    then returned car price should include 5% discount, otherwise 10%
    discount
